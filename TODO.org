* TODO Read Fun with semirings: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/papers/semirings.pdf

* TODO Complete "Square snr (B shape shape₁)"
* TODO Do some of the proofs (isCommMon; zeroˡ; zeroʳ; _<∙>_)
** lifting commutative monoid works for non square shapes?
* TODO Try to implement closure (either pentrate the ValiantAgda version or roll your own)
  What is a closed seminearring? for a semiring closure satisfies
  $a^* = 1 + a ∙ a^*$, but in seminearring there is no 1...

  $a^+ = a + a^+ ∙ a^+$ <--- ("quadratic equation" in ValiantAgda)

* TODO Implement matrix determinant (with block matrices)
  there is a block matrix decomposition of the determinant:

  det(A B ; C D) = det(A)det(D - CA^{-1}B) (requires A to be invertible)

  A is invertible when: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix#Blockwise_inversion
