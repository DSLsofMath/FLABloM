  The category Mat_K over some structure K (a Rg in this setting, ring
  w/o multiplicative identity and negation).

  "Abelian category" / "Category R-Mod of modules over some ring R"

  (intuition: modules: generalised vector spaces, linear maps (arrows between
  vector spaces) are matrices?)

  objects: shapes
  arrows: $r <- c$: matrices ~M K r c~
  composition: matrix multiplication
  identities: square (identity) matrices $a <- a$
  - m : r <- c, id : c <- c. m . id : r <- c
  - m : r <- c, id : r <- r. id . m : r <- c

  What kind of category does adding the closure make?

  What is a closed seminearring? for a semiring closure satisfies
  $a^* = 1 + a ∙ a^*$, but in seminearring there is no 1...

  $a^+ = a + a^+ ∙ a^+$ <--- ("quadratic equation" in ValiantAgda)

* TODO Look at empty shapes
  perhaps add an empty shape (but probably in a separate
  experiment file because many things change in the matrix
  representation).
* TODO Implement matrix determinant (with block matrices)
  CLOSED: [2016-02-19 Fri 11:00]

  there is a block matrix decomposition of the determinant:

  det(A B ; C D) = det(A)det(D - CA^{-1}B) (requires A to be invertible)

  A is invertible when: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix#Blockwise_inversion

  Generalised determinants:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra#Alternating_multilinear_forms

  Determinants that work with matrices over things that are noncommutative:
  - Dieudonné determinant: matrices over division rings
  - Quasideterminant: still needs negation and inversion
