* TODO Complete "Square snr (B shape shape₁)"
* TODO Do some of the proofs (isCommMon; zeroˡ; zeroʳ; _<∙>_)
** lifting commutative monoid works for non square shapes?
* TODO Try to implement closure (either pentrate the ValiantAgda version or roll your own)
* TODO Implement matrix determinant (with block matrices)
  there is a block matrix decomposition of the determinant:

  det(A B ; C D) = det(A)det(D - CA^{-1}B) (requires A to be invertible)

  A is invertible when: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix#Blockwise_inversion
