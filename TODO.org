* TODO Read Fun with semirings: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sd601/papers/semirings.pdf
  Implement n
* TODO Redo the Seminearring for non-square matrices (and define square as a special case on th outside)
* TODO Read http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.4818v1.pdf
* TODO Sätt igång med "rapport" (baserat på mall från https://github.com/patrikja/skeleton )
* DONE Complete "Square snr (B shape shape₁)"
  CLOSED: [2015-11-26 Thu 09:04]
** DONE Do some of the proofs (isCommMon; zeroˡ; zeroʳ; _<∙>_)
   CLOSED: [2015-11-26 Thu 09:05]
*** lifting commutative monoid works for non square shapes?
* TODO Try to implement closure (either pentrate the ValiantAgda version or roll your own)
  What is a closed seminearring? for a semiring closure satisfies
  $a^* = 1 + a ∙ a^*$, but in seminearring there is no 1...

  $a^+ = a + a^+ ∙ a^+$ <--- ("quadratic equation" in ValiantAgda)

* TODO Implement matrix determinant (with block matrices)
  there is a block matrix decomposition of the determinant:

  det(A B ; C D) = det(A)det(D - CA^{-1}B) (requires A to be invertible)

  A is invertible when: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix#Blockwise_inversion

  Generalised determinants:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_algebra#Alternating_multilinear_forms

  Determinants that work with matrices over things that are noncommutative:
  - Dieudonné determinant: matrices over division rings
  - Quasideterminant: still needs negation and inversion
